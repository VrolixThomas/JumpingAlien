This repository JumpingAlien contains the code for the OGP assignment of academic year 2018-2019.
The game is based around a character called Mazubke, who has to find his way in a world full of enemies and other 
obstacles, sort of like Super Mario. 

The code is written by DanaÃ« Van de Velde & Thomas Vrolix, part of the code and all graphics were provided by Ku leuven.
